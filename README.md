# Software to control an electric go-kart
Divided into 3 master directories (uC, app, web).

### uC
This software runs on our Arduino microcontroller. It operates and checks the status of various go-kart parts (e.g. motors, battery, and linear actuator). It also communicates with a smartphone via bluetooth shield.

### app
This software runs on your smartphone. It allows you to operate the go-kart (driving, breaking, power, and steering) from a graphical user interface.

### web
